HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION 
This project applies Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of a patient developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within 10 years.
The dataset used is the Framingham Heart Study, which contains over 4,000 records and 15 attributes related to cardiovascular health.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can assist in early detection and prevention of heart disease.
